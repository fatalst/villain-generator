# Villain Generator
Randomly generates a D&D villain and spits it out for your use!  Currently in development as a twitter bot, but may be adapted to be a website instead.  We'll see :)

## Generator Parts
### Structure
A/An `characteristic` `kind of person` who `backstory` and is now `thing they are currently doing` in order to `goal`.
