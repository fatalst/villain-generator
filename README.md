# Villain Generator
Randomly generates a D&D villain and spits it out for your use!  Currently in development as a twitter bot, but may be adapted to be a website instead.  We'll see :)

## To Do
- Finish building out generated sentence structure.
- Fill up various arrays of data.
- ~~Convert arrays to scalable, easily edited items (JSON potentially).~~
- Attach to Twitter account with relevant keys & tokens.
	- (ALTERNATIVELY) Create website.
