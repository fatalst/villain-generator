# Villain Generator
Randomly generates a D&D villain and spits it out for your use!  Currently in development as a twitter bot, but may be adapted to be a website instead.  We'll see :)

## Generator Parts
### Structure
A/An `characteristic` `kind of person` who `backstory` and is now `thing they are currently doing` in order to `goal`.

### Examples
*These were actually created by the generator so some might make not as much sense as others.*

###### Fantasy
- A cannibalistic brass dragon who had been an infamous thief and is now assassinating powerful people in order to win back their lover.
- A fiery warlock who had mentored a famous adventurer and is now committing mass murder in order to stop someone worse than them.
- A wealthy paladin who had been betrayed by a close friend and is now waking up a powerful creature in order to defeat a rival.

### Numbers
